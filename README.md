This project combines the power of YOLO object detection with the versatility of an ESP32 microcontroller to create a robust and adaptable automation system.  A user-friendly Flask web interface provides intuitive control and real-time visualization.


## üöÄ Features

* **Real-time Object Detection:**  Utilizes the YOLO algorithm for accurate and fast object detection in live camera feeds.
* **ESP32 Integration:** Seamlessly communicates with an ESP32 microcontroller, allowing for precise control of robotic actuators or other hardware.
* **Intuitive Web Interface:** A Flask-based web application provides an easy-to-use interface for camera selection, parameter adjustment, and monitoring of the system's status.
* **Visual Feedback:**  Real-time visualization of the detected objects overlaid on the camera feed.
* **Customizable Actions:** Configure actions triggered by the detection of specific objects.


## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/IEEE-Project-readme.git
   cd IEEE-Project-readme
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Flash the ESP32:**  (Instructions specific to your ESP32 firmware and communication protocol will be provided here.  Replace `<firmware_path>` with the actual path.)
   ```bash
   esptool.py --port <port> write_flash -z <firmware_path>
   ```

5. **Run the Flask application:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`


## üí° Usage Examples

**1. Selecting a Camera:** Upon opening the web interface, select your desired camera from the dropdown menu.

**2. Object Detection:** The application will display a live feed from the selected camera with detected objects highlighted by bounding boxes.

**3. ESP32 Control (Example):**  Assume you want to trigger a motor when a "ball" is detected.  The code within `app.py` would include logic like this (replace with your actual code):

```python
# ... other code ...

if "ball" in detections:
    # Send command to ESP32 to activate the motor
    send_esp32_command("MOTOR_ON")

# ... other code ...
```
